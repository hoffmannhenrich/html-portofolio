<h1>The Best Movies According to Henrich</h1>
<h2>My top 3 tv-shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourites tv shows, its about Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with lung cancer and he decides to break bad and starts cooking meth with his ex high school student Jesse.</p>
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>Really cool drama, about Lincoln Burrows, who end up in prison for killing the vice president brother, and its also about Michael Scofield, Lincolns brother, who also gets in prison, but only to break his brother out from there.</p>
<h3>The wire</h3>
<p>Its a harsh drama tv show, about Baltimore hoods and all the gangs in there slinging dope and trying to survive, but actually is about the cops that are trying to get them all, on wire.</p>
